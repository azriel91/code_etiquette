# Issue Tracker

Short version: A glorified Todo list.

Long version, a Todo list with the following features:

* **Summary:** Title of the issue / ticket &mdash; thing to do.
* **Description:** Details of what / why it is an issue.
* **Priority:** How soon must we fix it?
* **Status:** Has this been done?
* **Version:** What version of the software contains this bug? What version of the software will contain this feature?
* **Labels:** Grouping issues together, e.g. This issue is part of the "better error handling" group of tasks.
* **Assignee:** Who's working on it?
* ...

Example tickets:

* [awspec](https://github.com/k1LoW/awspec/issues/218): Not very detailed, "I want this".
* [rust-derive-builder](https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder/issues/43): Detailed with examples.
* [bitbucket server](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-4628): Issue on the Jira issue tracker.

# Rationale

Code etiquette is a set of rules or guidelines for how and what code gets into a repository. Most people have an idea or preference for what "good" looks like. What matters in a repository differs from person to person, project to project.

In projects with multiple maintainers, everyone should agree on standards for:

* Code design / style
* What "done" means: tests, documentation
* Workflow: how code gets in

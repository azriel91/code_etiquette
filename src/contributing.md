**Pull requests:** "I want my code to be part of the project's source code"

The contribution process normally has 3 parts:

1. I want to change something &mdash; I open a ticket in the *Issue Tracker*
2. I changed the code, and upload it for the repository owner(s) to review. The reviewers read the code, and say "it's good", or "no you need to change this".
3. Validation of whether the code works &mdash; Continuous Integration.
4. The code is merged into the repository.

Usually there is a file called `contributing.md` which explains what to do when you want to submit code ([example](https://github.com/k1LoW/awspec/blob/master/doc/contributing.md)).

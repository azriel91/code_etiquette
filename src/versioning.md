# Versioning

Versioning is a way to describe different copies of a project over time. Obvious examples are:

* Windows:
    - 95, 98, ME, XP, XP SP2, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10
    - Home Edition, Office Edition, Ultimate Edition
* Samsung Galaxy
    - S2 ~ S7
    - Note 7

Versioning allows you to say there's more to my project than this, but here have some of it.

## Semantic Versioning

Instead of simply having a single number for your version, you have 3 numbers: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.

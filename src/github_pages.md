# Github Pages

Github provides free of charge website hosting. There's two ways to do this:

* Create a repository called `<username>.github.io` ([example](https://github.com/azriel91/azriel91.github.io)).

    To access the page, you can either go to `https://<username>.github.io`, or if the owner has set up a custom domain, you can access it from there as well ([azriel91.github.io](https://azriel91.github.io), [azriel.im](http://azriel.im)).

* The `gh-pages` branch of any of your repositories. Many people set up their build to automatically commit to this branch of their repository where they publish documentation ([example](https://github.com/azriel91/builder_macro)).

    To access the page, navigate to `https://<username>.github.io/<repository_name>` ([azriel91.github.io/builder_macro](https://azriel91.github.io/builder_macro), [azriel.im/builder_macro](http://azriel.im/builder_macro)).
